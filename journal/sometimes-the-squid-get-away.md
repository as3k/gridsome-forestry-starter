title: Sometimes, The Squid Get Away.
excerpt: It was 1923 and there were so many fishermen you could feel the static shock
  in the air. "PUT ON YOUR PANTS, BOYS WE'RE GETTIN' SQUID!" a voice rang out over
  the crowd but they didn't know what would hit em.

# The Squiddening

That morning started just as it had every day in Silverman's Cowl. Boring. The smell of fresh fish being brought to port by the local fishermen and the sounds of skeevy fish dealers trying to undercut hard-working men out of their haul for shackles on the dollar. "Get out of here Jeeb! I told you last week if you want to pay shit prices go to someone who doesn't value their fish. I know what I have here and if you want it you're going to pay what it's worth!" Benjamin Telluride was a legend around these parts but these bottom feeders didn't know that. His blue overalls, rubber deck boots, and blood stained white shirt told everything you needed to know about the catch they had last night on The Portola - Capt. Telluride's pride and joy, and the oldest ship in Silverman's Cowl.
